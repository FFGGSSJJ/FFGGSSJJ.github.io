## ABOUT ME

- *He/Him/We*
- *Junior Student in Computer Engineering* 
- *E-mail: gf9@illinois.edu*

I am persuing my *Bachelor Degree* in ZJU-UIUC Institute and I am now exchanging in UIUC.

For now, my research interests are in ***Computer Architecture***, ***High Performance Calculation***, etc. I am now working on a FPGA-related project which focuses on a compression algorithm of paging in Linux kernel. The project is guided by *[Professor Nam Sung Kim](https://csl.illinois.edu/directory/faculty/nskim)*, instructed by his phd and MS  in UIUC.
